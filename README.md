🎓 Student Placement Prediction System

A Machine Learning–based project that predicts whether a student is likely to get placed based on academic performance, skills, interview performance, and other factors.
The project includes model training, a Flask backend, and an interactive Streamlit frontend.

🚀 Features :-

📊 Machine Learning model using Random Forest
🧠 Rule-based + ML hybrid data generation
🌐 Flask API for backend predictions
🎨 Streamlit web app for user interaction
📈 Confidence score with placement prediction
🧪 Scenario-based testing

🛠️ Tech Stack :-

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
Web Framework: Flask
Frontend: Streamlit
Model: Random Forest Classifier

📌 How It Works  :- 

User enters academic and skill details
Data is passed to the trained ML model
Model predicts placement (Yes / No)
Confidence score is displayed
Result shown via UI (popup/message)

📈 Model Logic (High Level) :- 

10th & 12th marks → Eligibility check
CGPA → Academic strength
Technical skills & interview performance 
Backlogs & low IQ → Penalty

🎯 Use Cases :-

Campus placement analysis
Student self-assessment
Academic ML demonstrations
